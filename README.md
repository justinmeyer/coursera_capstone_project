# Coursera/Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Data Science Specialization Capstone Project

This repository is the source for a project to meet the capstone project requirements for the **Coursera/Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Data Science Specialization.**

The project is a web app that, when given one or more words, predicts the next word, just like the texting app on a smartphone. The app can be found at <https://justinmeyer.shinyapps.io/coursera_capstone_project>. *Enter a word or words to return a table of predicted words and a chart of their frequencies in the source data.*

There is a presentation describing the web app and the methods it uses at <http://rpubs.com/justinmeyer/coursera_data_science_capstone_project_presentation>.
